   This paper provides the methodology for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance and derived vegetation indices. The model is implemented in `scripts/gee/3. AGB_Model_Sentinel2_Template.js` and validated against ESA CCI data in `scripts/gee/4. AGB_Model_Comparison_vCCI.js`.
